# ProceduralTuba
Ever wanted a tuba soundtrack while you walk? No? Okay, here you go!

I made this because [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/FrydaWolff/status/699350919117275136) made me laugh.

I'll clean up the code and get it generating more interesting and varied melodies soon, but it's free for you to pull down and mess with yourself, use however you want, etc. Go nuts! 

I hope it makes you laugh, too.
